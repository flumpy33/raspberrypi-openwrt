# Goals #
  1. ~~Add support for the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).~~ (Done)
  1. ~~Create a single [development environment](SoftwareDevelopment.md) for kernel, root file system and SD card image creation.~~ (Done)
  1. Add [Qt 5](http://wiki.qt-project.org/Qt_RaspberryPi) to the OpenWRT environment.

# Possible Applications #
  * NAS (Samba + Luci web-access).
  * ~~Mediaplayer: [XBMC](http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/604)~~ Why try to reinvent the wheel? Just use [OpenELEC](http://openelec.tv/).
  * Webserver (Apache up and running from openWRT build)
  * Router
  * Home automation / domotica
